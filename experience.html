                        <p>As I reflect on my professional journey, I'm struck by the diverse experiences that have shaped my career path. At Brigham Young University, I am pursuing a major in Information Systems with a special focus on Entrepreneurship and Technology. This choice was driven by my passion for staying at the forefront of technological advancements and my entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
                        <p>My work experience commenced at Cost Plus World Market in Woodinville, WA, from November 2017 to February 2018. Here, I delved into the retail environment, mastering the stock system, and learning the nuances of product cycling to maximize sales. This role also honed my customer service skills, as I operated point-of-sale systems and adeptly handled customer inquiries.</p>
                        <p>From March 2019 to September 2019, I served as an Associate Trainer at Panera Bread in Lynnwood, WA. In this role, I deepened my understanding of product and service offerings and cultivated essential skills like patience and effective communication, especially in fast-paced situations.</p>
                        <p>A significant shift in my career occurred when I joined the missionary force for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as a Personal Assistant to the President and Full-Time Representative in Northern Italy, from February 2020 to June 2022. This position not only refined my interpersonal skills through cold-calling and daily interactions but also developed my leadership abilities as I guided and supervised up to 130 full-time representatives.</p>
                        <p>Following this, I joined Home Depot in Bothell, WA, as a Pro Sales Associate from June 2022 to September 2022. My role involved liaising with business clients, becoming adept in company software, and resolving complex customer inquiries, which required a comprehensive understanding of interdepartmental operations.</p>
                        <p>Most recently, I began teaching Italian at the MTC, imparting language skills to groups ranging between 6 and 14 students. This teaching experience has been instrumental in enhancing my communication, organization, and pedagogical skills, challenging me to adapt to various learning styles and effectively convey complex information.</p>
                        <p>Each of these experiences, marked by their respective timelines, has been a stepping stone in my career, equipping me with a versatile skill set and a dynamic approach to professional challenges. As I continue to grow and evolve in my career, I remain dedicated to learning, innovating, and leading with a commitment to excellence and integrity.</p>
